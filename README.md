# Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project implements a simple Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling Simulator in C. The simulator includes three priority queues for high, medium, and low-priority processes, and it uses a combination of Round Robin and First In First Out (FIFO) scheduling algorithms.

## Functionality

- High, medium, and low-priority queues
- Round Robin and FIFO scheduling algorithms
- Simulation of process execution

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
   ```bash
   gcc your_file.c -o scheduler


## Run the executable.
bash
./scheduler


## Example Processes
Process 1: Burst Time = 4, Arrival Time = 0, Priority = 1 (high)
Process 2: Burst Time = 6, Arrival Time = 1, Priority = 2 (medium)
Process 3: Burst Time = 5, Arrival Time = 2, Priority = 1 (high)
Process 4: Burst Time = 3, Arrival Time = 3, Priority = 2 (medium)
Process 5: Burst Time = 7, Arrival Time = 4, Priority = 3 (low)
Process 6: Burst Time = 10, Arrival Time = 5, Priority = 3 (low)
Adjust the processes and priorities as needed in the code.
